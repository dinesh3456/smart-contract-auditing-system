# Smart Contract Audit Report: TestContract
  
  **Contract Address:** N/A  
  **Audit Date:** 2025-03-24  
  **Overall Risk Rating:** low
  
  ## Executive Summary
  
  This audit identified 3 vulnerabilities and 1 gas optimization opportunities.
  
  ## Vulnerabilities
  
  
  ### Reentrancy (High)
  
  - **Location:** Line 26 in contract.sol
  - **Description:** Function transfer makes an external call and then changes state afterward. This allows an attacker to re-enter the function before state changes are applied.
  - **Recommendation:** Follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern: first perform all checks, then make state changes, and finally interact with external contracts.
  
  ### Reentrancy (High)
  
  - **Location:** Line 41 in contract.sol
  - **Description:** Function transferFrom makes an external call and then changes state afterward. This allows an attacker to re-enter the function before state changes are applied.
  - **Recommendation:** Follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern: first perform all checks, then make state changes, and finally interact with external contracts.
  
  ### Reentrancy (High)
  
  - **Location:** Line 63 in contract.sol
  - **Description:** Function mint makes an external call and then changes state afterward. This allows an attacker to re-enter the function before state changes are applied.
  - **Recommendation:** Follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern: first perform all checks, then make state changes, and finally interact with external contracts.
  
  
  ## Gas Optimization Issues
  
  
  ### Loop condition reads array length in each iteration
  
  - **Location:** Line 74 in contract.sol
  - **Gas Saved:** Up to 100+ gas per loop iteration
  - **Recommendation:** Cache array length in a local variable before the loop to save gas.
  
  
  ## Compliance Results
  
  
  ### ERC20
  
  - **Status:** Non-compliant
  - **Missing Requirements:** Missing function: totalSupply - Returns the total token supply, Missing function: balanceOf - Returns the account balance of an account, Missing function: allowance - Returns the amount of tokens the spender is allowed to spend on behalf of the owner, Missing event: Transfer - Must be emitted when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers, Missing event: Approval - Must be emitted when approval is set or changed
  - **Recommendations:** Consider inheriting from the OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation to ensure full compliance., Always emit Transfer and Approval events when token balances or allowances change., The transfer function should emit the Transfer event., Consider adding checks to prevent transfers to the zero address (0x0).
  
  ### ERC721
  
  - **Status:** Non-compliant
  - **Missing Requirements:** Missing function: balanceOf - Returns the number of NFTs owned by an address, Missing function: ownerOf - Returns the owner of a specific NFT, Missing function: safeTransferFrom - Safely transfers the ownership of a given token ID to another address with data parameter, Missing function: safeTransferFrom - Safely transfers the ownership of a given token ID to another address, Missing function: getApproved - Gets the approved address for a token ID, Missing function: setApprovalForAll - Approves or removes operator for all tokens for the caller, Missing function: isApprovedForAll - Tells whether an operator is approved by an owner, Missing event: Transfer - Emitted when tokenId is transferred from from to to, Missing event: Approval - Emitted when owner approves tokenId to approved, Missing event: ApprovalForAll - Emitted when owner enables or disables operator for all tokens
  - **Recommendations:** Consider inheriting from the OpenZeppelin ERC721 implementation to ensure full compliance., Always emit appropriate events (Transfer, Approval, ApprovalForAll) when state changes., Consider adding reentrancy protection to safeTransferFrom functions to prevent potential reentrancy attacks., Consider adding checks to prevent transfers to the zero address (0x0) to avoid permanent loss of NFTs., Ensure tokenURI and ownerOf functions check that the tokenId exists before returning data., Consider implementing ERC721Metadata interface (name, symbol, tokenURI) for better NFT compatibility., Consider implementing ERC721Enumerable interface for better marketplace and indexer support.
